            <h3>Interactive Web Calculator</h3>
            <p> As part of my web development journey, I designed and implemented an interactive web calculator. This project was a great opportunity to showcase my proficiency in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
                The calculator provides a user-friendly interface with a sleek design and intuitive functionality. It supports basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. Users can easily input numbers and perform calculations with a responsive and dynamic display.
                The project also incorporates error handling to ensure accurate calculations and enhance the user experience. The calculator is fully responsive, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes and devices.
                Check out the live demo to experience the calculator in action and feel free to explore the source code on my GitHub repository. I enjoyed working on this project, and it reflects my commitment to creating practical and aesthetically pleasing solutions.
